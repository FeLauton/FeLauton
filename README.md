## 🇬🇧 About

Tech Lead with strong hands-on involvement in backend and cloud systems.

I design and implement scalable, secure and maintainable distributed architectures, while leading technical direction, defining standards and supporting engineering teams.

Core focus:

- Backend architecture with Node.js and TypeScript
- Cloud infrastructure on AWS
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Event-driven systems
- API management
- High-availability and production-grade systems

I prioritize architectural clarity, explicit boundaries, security by design and reproducible environments.
